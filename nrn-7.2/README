This is very out of date.

As of version 4.2.2., the neuron compilation procedure has been
completely redone.  There are some substantial differences from older
versions of neuron, so please read the beginning of the INSTALL file
before you try to build it.

Some examples of neuron .hoc and .mod files are contained in the
examples subdirectory of the distribution.  These files are not
installed since they aren't at all important for running neuron, but you 
may want to look through them.
